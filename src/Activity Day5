<!-- Now we’re ready to create an “About me” page.

To create this page, you'll be adding the following HTML tags which we discussed in this lesson:

- <h1> A first level heading tag. Normally there’s only one of these on a page, and it’s used to indicate the most important header.
  
- <h2> A second level heading tag. This is used for headers that are less important than <h1>. HTML gives us <h1> to <h6>. From <h2> on, it’s fine to use more than one on a page. Note that these heading tags help Google’s web crawlers understand what a page is about, and therefore are crucial for SEO. They also set default styling for any text they wrap (so an H1, for instance, will have bigger, bolder font than a paragraph, by default in all modern browsers).
  
- <p> The paragraph tag, which you’ll be shocked to learn is used to indicate that a grouping of text is a paragraph.
  - <span> Similar to the <p> tag, it identifies groups of texts, but in this case, smaller ones that might later have different styles.
  
- <ul> or <ol> The unordered/ordered list tag is used in conjunction with the <li> tag to represent un-numbered/numbered, lists of items.
  - <li> Used to indicate a list item in a <ul> or <ol>.
  
- <a> The anchor tag, which is used to link to another part of the page, or another page entirely.
  
- <div> The div tag, which is a generic container element, used to group together content. Try to wrap all other elements inside this tag.

- <img> to add cool images to your website! you can copy the URLs from other websites and use them. For testing/practicing purposes of course ;)

- <form> the form tag identifies the start of a form that will be used to allow the user to send information
  - <label> to identify the name of a input!
  - <input> to allow the user to fill in information.
  - <button> can be used by themselves, but inside forms they allow you to grab all information from the input fields to send it.
